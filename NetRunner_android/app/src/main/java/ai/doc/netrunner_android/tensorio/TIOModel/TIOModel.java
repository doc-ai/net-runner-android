/**
 * This is the primary API provided by the TensorIO framework.
 * <p>
 * A TIOModel is built from a bundle folder that contains the underlying model, a json description of the model’s input and output layers, and any additional assets required by the model, for example, output labels.
 * <p>
 * A conforming TIOModel begins by parsing a json description of the model’s input and output layers, producing a TIOLayerInterface for each layer. Each layer is fully described by a conforming TIOLayerDescription, which describes the data the layer expects or produces, for example, whether it is quantized, any transformations that should be applied to it, and the number of bytes the layer expects.
 * <p>
 * To perform inference with the underlying model, call runOn: with a conforming TIOData object. TIOData objects simply know how to copy bytes to and receive bytes from a model’s input and output layers. Internally, this method matches TIOData objects with their corresponding layers and ensures that bytes are copied to the right place. The runOn: method then returns a conforming TIOData object, which is the result of performing inference with the model. Objects that conform to the TIOData protocol include NSNumber, NSArray, NSData, NSDictionary, and TIOPixelBuffer, which wraps a CVPixelBuffer for computer vision models.
 * <p>
 * For more information about a model’s interface, refer to the TIOLayerInterface and TIOLayerDescription classes. For more information about the kinds of Objective-C data a TIOModel can work with, refer to the TIOData protocol and its conforming classes.
 * <p>
 * Note that, currently, only TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models are supported.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: Models are not thread safe. Models may be used on separate threads, so that you can perform inference off the main thread, but you should not use the same model from multiple threads.
