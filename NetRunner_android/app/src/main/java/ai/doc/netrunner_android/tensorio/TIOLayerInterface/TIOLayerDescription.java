 * A layer description encapsulates information about an input or output tensor that is needed
 * to copy bytes into and out of it. For example, a vector layer description
 * for an input tensor describes any transformations the submitted data must undergo before the
 * underlying bytes are copied to the tensor, e.g. quantization and normalization, as well as the
 * shape of the expected input, which determines how many bytes are copied into the tensor.
